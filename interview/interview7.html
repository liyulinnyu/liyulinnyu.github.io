        <div class="text"><h4>1. CSS Sprite</h4>Put all the small pictures into one large picture. 
(1) It's better not to use it in content pictures(img label). But some descriptive pictures can use it.
(2) For both horizontal and vertical tiled images also cannot be merged into the Sprite map.
(3) Put all horizontal tiled pictures together, arranged vertically.
(4) Put all vertical tiled pictures together, arranged horizontally.
(5) In the CSS, you should use "background-position:x y;" to cut the pictures you want.

Advantages:
(1) Less HTTP requests
(2) Increase the loading speed

DisAdvantages:
(1) Have some white space that you won't use in the picture, because you have to use them to divide pictures.
(2) Affects browser scaling
(3) CSS Sprite pictures cannot be printed, unless using "@print"

<h4>2. Base64</h4>Display pictures by using Base64 encoding. (Google voice search button)
Such as: {background: url(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGOQW9LT1TRk1V7S2xYJADs=) no-repeat center;}

Advantages:
(1) Less HTTP requests

Disadvantages:
(1) Only used in small pictures(10k)
(2) After conversion, the file is about 1/3 larger than the picture, you have to use GZIP to compress it
(3) IE8+ support
(4) The time of CSS CRP(Critical Rendering Path) will increase

<h4>3. Picture types</h4>(1) "gif": mainly used in small icons
(2) "jpg": HD, big picture(Losing)
(3) "png8": used to replace gif, smaller size
(4) "png24": used to replace jpg, but its size is more bigger, sometimes used in half transparent picture
(5) "svg": vector diagram. Used in some icons, logos.
